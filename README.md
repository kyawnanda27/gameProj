# Take Care of Urself

## Purpose
The main focus of our game is to teach players a bit about the immune system, specifically how different types of immune cells deal with viruses and pathogens. Our game not only targets medical students but is also made to be understandable by someone who is outside of the medical profession since we believe that everyone should have some knowledge of our immune system. We created this game to educate our players with elements of fun inside so that players would enjoy it without having too much information to consume at once.

## Description and Guide
The player will be introduced to information about the immune cells before they start each level. Within that instruction, the player will not only get to know how to play on each level but also get to know the functions of each immune cell.

The player plays as different immune cells that navigate the ‘body’ and complete their roles/tasks. They have to survive the 1-minute timer before they can escape. Players start with 1 life and have a maximum of 3 lives. Any additional pills/medication/pathogen information collected will be converted to points (10 points per collection).

For the first level, we kept the old gameplay; players play as a dendritic cell, moving around and collecting pathogen information while avoiding actual viruses which would damage the player. In the second level, there is the added function for the player to engulf viruses. Now the player is a macrophage cell and can engulf up to 15 viruses before they take damage. From our research, macrophages are able to consume up to 100 viruses/pathogens/bacteria before they die off. In the third level, player play as neutrophils. They are able to secrete toxins (by shooting) and kill viruses.

Throughout the game, the concept of time and score stays the same. Players collect pills/medication that increases health much like in real life where people are able to consume such substances to build immunity. With the added features, there is now more of a storyline for each level and a more educational aspect to our game.
